i'm writing a program to use a disk as a network
if you have 2 computers
and you want to do fileshareing between them
but they're not networked
then my program, disknet, can still help, because it's just an addon to usb disks
once the disk and the computers are setup as a disknet,
then you have a folder on both computers that you can put files in
then when you sync with the disk
the dick knows about the files
and when it's pluged into a different computer, that computer can write to the disk that it wants those files
and when the disk is plugged into the computer that has them 
they'll be copied to the disk
and then when the disk is plugged into the computer that wants them, they're copied
only for linux
but i'll keep adding to it
so that it will hopefully work on windows
and work better
oh, and if the file is to big for the disk
than it's split into parts
and it will just take another trip or two, or three to get it over
